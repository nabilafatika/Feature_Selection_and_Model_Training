# Feature_Selection_and_Model_Training
This project focuses on Feature Selection and Model Training. In Feature Selection, we identify and choose the most relevant features from the dataset that contribute significantly to the predictive power of the model. This process helps improve model performance, reduces overfitting, and enhances interpretability. Model Training involves training machine learning models using the selected features to predict the target variable accurately. It includes preprocessing steps such as data cleaning, normalization, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets. Finally, we evaluate the trained models' performance using appropriate metrics to assess their accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

# Visualization
Scatter matrix plot is a plot used to create a set of scatter plots for multiple pairs of variables. It is particularly useful when analyzing the relationships between variables. This plot is beneficial for data sets with a moderate size. To use a scatter matrix, we need to call the scatter_matrix function from pandas.plotting.

# Modeling Process with KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)
KNN is a simple, easy-to-implement machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It works by finding the 'k' closest data points (neighbors) to the data point of interest and making a prediction based on the majority class (for classification) or average (for regression) of these neighbors.

# Evaluation of Confusion Matrix
A confusion matrix is a table used to evaluate the performance of a classification model. It shows the number of correct and incorrect predictions made by the model compared to the actual classifications in the test data.


This project, designed as one of my assignments for the Artificial Intelligence course during my college years, aims to explore advanced techniques in Feature Selection and Model Training. Its purpose is to delve into the methodologies of selecting relevant features from a dataset and training machine learning models effectively, with the ultimate goal of enhancing predictive performance and gaining insights from the data.
